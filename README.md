# "Evil" opam-repository

This opam repository contains packages that are mostly known to have archives
that are unavailable or have mismatching checksums. It is useful for testing
failure modes of e.g. [opam-mirror](https://git.robur.io/robur/opam-mirror).

As far as I know none of the packages are malicious in any way.
